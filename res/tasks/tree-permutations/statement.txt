Given a tree, we define the distance between two permutations A and B as the sum of distances between nodes A[i] and B[i] over all i.
Compute the largest distance between any two permutations for a given tree with N nodes.

Input:
The first line in a testcase contains the number of nodes in the tree N (1 <= N <= 1000 000).
The second line contains N - 1 integers. The i'th integer denotes the parent of the i + 1'st node.
The tree is guaranteed to be rooted in node 1, and the label of each node's parent is smaller than the node's label.
