## Group Projects

This year a staggering number of N students signed up for Object Oriented Pro-Gaming,
a course for which you just happen to be an instructor. You must assign each student
to a one or two person group for a mandatory project. From years of inexperience,
you know that groups are only productive if they consist of exactly one person, or
if for at least one of the group members, the other one maximizes the xor of the student
ID's within the group, of of all possible groups containing that student.

Grading projects takes time, which you have none of. That's why you want to partition
your students into the smallest number of groups possible. Compute how many groups
you'll need to make.

### input format
The first line contains the number of students N (1 <= N <= 1000).

The second line contains the student ID's of your students. You may assume that 
ID's are unique, and fit in signed 32-bit unsigned integers.

### output
Output the smallest possible number of groups that you can divide the students into.

### sample test
